In this project, I am creating various bash programs to learn how to effectively use bash and understand scripting.


SECOND COMMIT
I have had some issues committing the files, I had to find out how to merge and resolve errors before it could be pushed.

THIRD COMMIT
I have added the backup_ex3.sh script which redirects the stderr message to a null.txt file

FOURTH COMMIT
I added the backup_ex4.sh script which prints out details of how many files/directories will be backed up.
